The adapter pattern changes the interface of a class to an interface that the 
client expects. This is done by wrapping the class with the incompatible 
interface by another class which implements the compatible interface. The 
adapter pattern changes an interface to resolve a compatibility issue.

The facade pattern changes the interface of a class to simplify it. It hides 
the internal complexity of the class after a clean facade.
